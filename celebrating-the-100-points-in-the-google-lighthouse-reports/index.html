I tried to restart the server in the Rescue Mode and to reach it via the KVM Console. But this is was failing and I got a strange behavior from the VPS. It was stuck on the VM startup log:\nVPS Rescue Mode Startup Log\n So, I tried to connect in SSH to my VPS in the Rescue Mode. My last solution was to grab the Wordpress and MySQL files in hope to rescue the maximum amount of data.\nIn that moment, I discovered that I made a huge mistake when I didn’t setup a backup of my blog 😰 I really felt stupid to forget to do that 😫😢\nI will spend so much time to tell you how the recovery was painful but fortunately:\n I had a one month backup JSON file of the posts that I generated the Ghost Blogs Migration Process. So I used that to rescue the articles. I could grabbed the Medias from the VPS Disk thru the Rescue Mode. I copy/pasted the ingoing “Playing With Java In Azure Functions” article in Word when I found that the Wordpress Preview button not working.  So, I started by reinstalling the OS of the VPS. I have chosen the Wordpress Image from OVH, which is a Debian customized image with some Wordpress dedicated stuff. In the previous VPS, it was just Ubuntu 15.04 and it was not dedicated for hosting a blog. I brought it to do some Java EE programming on a Remote Server. When I got the idea of blogging, I thought in hosting my blog on my Programming Server. Which was really a very bad idea, but it was economic solution: less than 10$/month.\nI started configuring the new Wordpress instance. I imported all my Posts and Medias. I moved next to install plugins. I took into consideration to have a backup mechanism for my blog. After some heavy searches about the plugins to have, my final list is:\n UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore 👉 Backup and restore: take backups locally, or backup to Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Rackspace, (S)FTP, WebDAV \u0026 email, on automatic schedules.

WP Fastest Cache 👉 The simplest and fastest WP Cache system  Add to that I configured Cloudflare to boost the speed of my Wordpress Blog. After some tweaks and configuration, the scores started growing up 😁\nTo measure the efficiency of websites, Google has a great tool called Lighthouse.\nGoogle Lighthouse logo\n Google defines Lighthouse as:\n Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.\nYou can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.\n– Source: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\n After the hard job, that took 2 or 3 days of hard work in Performance, Accessibility, Speed and other, I successfully attended the 100/100 on the Google Lighthouse Audits Reports.\nLighthouse Audit Results\n Now, I have a real strong automated blog with:\n regular daily automatic backup of all the blog content backed up in the Google Drive 🥳 automatic broken links detection and notification 🥳 mailing notification based on GMail instead of the Hosting Provider one 🥳 accreditation that the blog responds to the most of the best practices 🥳 accreditation that the blog responds to accessibility standards 🥳 accreditation that the blog is very performant ! 🥳 the blog now has its Progressive Web Application version that is accessible offline ! 🥳  I’m very happy with this results !
