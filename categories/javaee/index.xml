Today, I will show you how to make a Reactive CRUD Application with the Quarkus Framework and backed by a PostgreSQL Database.
Building our the Reactive Quarkus Application The full source code is available on my Github.
We will generate our project using the code.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Azure Functions and Quarkus</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-functions-and-quarkus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-functions-and-quarkus/</guid><description>Quarkus is one of the current trends of the Java ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;m already in love with it. I&amp;rsquo;m using it along with Spring Boot, and when I choose, I choose Quarkus. 😁
This week, I was working on a Batch POC using Azure Functions and Azure Automation. So I thought it will be useful to share the exercise with you. 😁
What I want to do? I will be taking a small use case: I need a batch that will be invoked at some specific time or manually, checking all the available VMs and starting or shutting down all those that we choose.</description></item><item><title>"Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes" is available in Early Access</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</guid><description>Today is the big day 🥳🥳 My third book &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; is available in Early Access 🎉🎊🎈✨ Book cover
I started working on the book starting from June 😁 I spent nearly 5 months presenting the most interesting and powerful features of the Quarkus Framework.

This is done using a middleware between these applications as a Message Bus that enables them to work together.
One of the most used Messaging solutions is Apache Kafka: Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Report: ENSI – January 2020</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</guid><description>The workshop &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; was held from 02/01 to 04/01 - 2020, at the National School of Computer Sciences, in Manouba, Tunisia.

Introduction In this tutorial I will show you how to write a small Spring Boot CRUD application and how to deploy it on Kubernetes.
Spring Boot is an innovative project that aims to make it easy to create Spring applications by simplifying the configuration and deployment actions through its convention over configuration based setup.

Though the two terms mean different things, they are sometimes used interchangeably because of their respective roles in application security.
Get started with the fundamentals of web authentication and authorization using Apache Shiro Framework.
Apache Shiro is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management.
