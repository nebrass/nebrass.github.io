I&amp;rsquo;m already in love with it. I&amp;rsquo;m using it along with Spring Boot, and when I choose, I choose Quarkus. 😁
This week, I was working on a Batch POC using Azure Functions and Azure Automation. So I thought it will be useful to share the exercise with you. 😁
What I want to do? I will be taking a small use case: I need a batch that will be invoked at some specific time or manually, checking all the available VMs and starting or shutting down all those that we choose.</description></item><item><title>"Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes" is available in Early Access</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</guid><description>Today is the big day 🥳🥳 My third book &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; is available in Early Access 🎉🎊🎈✨ Book cover
I started working on the book starting from June 😁 I spent nearly 5 months presenting the most interesting and powerful features of the Quarkus Framework. When I started the Proof-of-concept, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the idea of writing a book on Quarkus, I was just discovering.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Spring Boot and Kafka on Azure Event Hub</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-boot-and-kafka-on-azure-event-hub/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-boot-and-kafka-on-azure-event-hub/</guid><description>In an enterprise level, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious for applications to be based on messaging for communication. This is done using a middleware between these applications as a Message Bus that enables them to work together.
One of the most used Messaging solutions is Apache Kafka: Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Spring Cloud in Azure Functions</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-cloud-in-azure-functions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-cloud-in-azure-functions/</guid><description>In this tutorial, we will be experimenting a new use case of the great Azure Functions service 😁 one of my favorite products in Azure.
In this tutorial, we will bring the powerful features of the Spring Framework to our Azure Functions Java projects. After this tutorial, creating a new Azure Functions Java based on business logic that you already have in your Spring Boot Application will be a very easy game.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Java in Azure Functions - New Release</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-in-azure-functions-new-release/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-in-azure-functions-new-release/</guid><description>In one of the previous posts, I introduced the Azure Functions Java. I felt that I need to write a dedicated tutorial to this great Azure Serverless service 😁
In this post, I will be covering many concepts in deep:
Triggers and bindings Events and messaging Deployments &amp;amp; Consumptions Monitoring Generating the hello-world project We will scaffold a Java-based Azure Function project using Maven Archetypes, using this command:</description></item><item><title>Playing with Azure Monitor services and Spring Boot</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-monitor-services-and-spring-boot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-monitor-services-and-spring-boot/</guid><description>In enterprise application, performance is major requirement of success. Especially for applications where slowness will have a direct detrimental impact on business productivity, profits and even the brand itself, like trading platforms and e-commerces.
If a trading platform loads slowly or experiences errors, it will translate into loss of business, and losses can be extremely high, and the customer might end up switching to another competitor.
In this context comes the Application Performance Management (APM).</description></item><item><title>Playing with Java in Azure Functions and Azure DevOps</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-in-azure-functions-and-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-in-azure-functions-and-azure-devops/</guid><description>Before the introduction This is my first tutorial about one of the Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s tools and platforms.. I started working for Microsoft on May 6th, I started to look to this huge and mysterious world by the eyes of a Java Developer. I will try to make some tutorials based on the great tools that I use or discover in the Microsoft ecosystem 😊
⚠️ Disclaimer : This is not a marketing content 😆 I just want to share with you a feedback about tooling to boost your productivity and to make the Java journey wonderful 😍</description></item></channel></rss>
