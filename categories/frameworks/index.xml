I started working on the book starting from June 😁 I spent nearly 5 months presenting the most interesting and powerful features of the Quarkus Framework. When I started the Proof-of-concept, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the idea of writing a book on Quarkus, I was just discovering.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Spring Boot and Kafka on Azure Event Hub</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-boot-and-kafka-on-azure-event-hub/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-spring-boot-and-kafka-on-azure-event-hub/</guid><description>In an enterprise level, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious for applications to be based on messaging for communication. This is done using a middleware between these applications as a Message Bus that enables them to work together.
One of the most used Messaging solutions is Apache Kafka: Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Report: ENSI – January 2020</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</guid><description>The workshop &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; was held from 02/01 to 04/01 - 2020, at the National School of Computer Sciences, in Manouba, Tunisia.

Though the two terms mean different things, they are sometimes used interchangeably because of their respective roles in application security.
Get started with the fundamentals of web authentication and authorization using Apache Shiro Framework.
Apache Shiro is a powerful and easy-to-use Java security framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management.
Learn how to use Shiro in a JavaEE7 application and how to use it in a web application.</description></item></channel></rss>
