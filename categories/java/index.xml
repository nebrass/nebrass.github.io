Today, I will show you how to make a Reactive CRUD Application with the Quarkus Framework and backed by a PostgreSQL Database.

We will generate our project using the code.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Azure Functions and Quarkus</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-functions-and-quarkus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-azure-functions-and-quarkus/</guid><description>Quarkus is one of the current trends of the Java ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;m already in love with it. I&amp;rsquo;m using it along with Spring Boot, and when I choose, I choose Quarkus. 😁
This week, I was working on a Batch POC using Azure Functions and Azure Automation. So I thought it will be useful to share the exercise with you. 😁
What I want to do? I will be taking a small use case: I need a batch that will be invoked at some specific time or manually, checking all the available VMs and starting or shutting down all those that we choose.</description></item><item><title>"Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes" is available in Early Access</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/</guid><description>Today is the big day 🥳🥳 My third book &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices with Quarkus and Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; is available in Early Access 🎉🎊🎈✨ Book cover
I started working on the book starting from June 😁 I spent nearly 5 months presenting the most interesting and powerful features of the Quarkus Framework.

This is done using a middleware between these applications as a Message Bus that enables them to work together.
One of the most used Messaging solutions is Apache Kafka: Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Report: ENSI – January 2020</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/workshop-report-ensi-january-2020/</guid><description>The workshop &amp;ldquo;Playing with Java Microservices on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; was held from 02/01 to 04/01 - 2020, at the National School of Computer Sciences, in Manouba, Tunisia.

Everyone is enjoying (I hope 😆) the Docker experience, compared to the traditional VMs. But, the Docker containerization will not come alone.. nothing is autonomous 😁 So, there are many concerns to take into consideration while containerizing Java applications, like playing with the JVM.
The Docker racing was accelerated by the presence of Kubernetes in the market, which is coming with an amazing set of great features.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Serverless in Kubernetes with Knative</title><link>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-serverless-in-kubernetes-with-knative/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-serverless-in-kubernetes-with-knative/</guid><description>The serverless architecture became one of the most buzzy words nowadays.

Especially for applications where slowness will have a direct detrimental impact on business productivity, profits and even the brand itself, like trading platforms and e-commerces.
If a trading platform loads slowly or experiences errors, it will translate into loss of business, and losses can be extremely high, and the customer might end up switching to another competitor.
