When I started the Proof-of-concept, I didn’t have the idea of writing a book on Quarkus, I was just discovering. I found myself spending more and more time reading the documentation, trying some features and extensions, and then I got the idea to write the Quarkus version of my “Playing with Java Microservices” Book 😁\nThe content of book:\n Chapter 0: Getting started with Containerization, presents the containerization with Docker \u0026 Podman. Chapter 1: Introduction to the Monolithic architecture, provides an introduction to the Monolithic architecture with a focus on its advantages and drawbacks. Chapter 2: Coding the Monolithic application, offers a step-by-step tutorial for modeling and creating the monolith using Maven, Java 11 \u0026 Quarkus. Chapter 3: Upgrading the Monolithic application, lists some upgrades for our Monolithic application such as adding tests and most-wanted features. Chapter 4: Building \u0026 Deploying the Monolithic application, covers how to build and package our example application before showing how to deploy it in the runtime environment. Chapter 5: Adding the anti-disasters layers, introduces how to implement the Security and Monitoring layers to help the application to avoid disasters. Chapter 6: Microservices Architecture Pattern, presents the drawbacks that can be faced in a typical Monolithic architecture and shows the motivations for seeking something new, like the Microservices Architecture Pattern. Chapter 7: Splitting the Monolith: Bombarding the domain, presents the Domain Driven Design concepts to successfully understand the Business Domain of the Monolithic Application, to be able to split it into sub-domains. Chapter 8: Applying DDD to the code, shows how to apply all the DDD concepts to the Monolithic Application source code and to successfully split the monolith into Bounded Contexts. Chapter 9: Meeting the microservices concerns and patterns, covers a deep presentation of the concerns and the cloud patterns related to the Microservices Architecture Pattern. Chapter 10: Getting started with Kubernetes, covers how to build our real standalone business microservices. Chapter 11: Implementing the Cloud Patterns, presents in deep the greatest container orchestrator: Kubernetes Chapter 12: Building the Kubernetized Microservices, shows how to migrate the monolith code to build microservices while applying Kubernetes concepts and features. Chapter 13: Flying all over the Sky with Quarkus and Kubernetes will introduce you to how implement additional cloud patterns using Quarkus and Kubernetes.  The remaining chapters:\n Chapter 14: Playing with Quarkus in Azure shows how Microsoft Azure can help you to modernize applications faster and how you can use Serverless Architecture to add additional great features. Chapter 15: Bringing Dapr into the game presents Dapr \u0026 covers how a Distributed Application Runtime can improve a microservices architecture. and more 😁  I made the book available under Early Access because I didn’t finish the Azure part: where I will be covering many great Azure services useful to boost the efficiency of my Quarkus microservices. I will also cover more topics and tools that I see that can be a great add-on to the actual content. The eBook version of the book will be continuously updated. Stay tuned 😎\nThe book is available in Gumroad and Leanpub, and soon will be available in Amazon and Google Play 🥳\n","wordCount":"571","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.nebrass.fr/images/quarkus-book-cover.webp","datePublished":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.nebrass.fr/playing-with-java-microservices-with-quarkus-and-kubernetes-is-available-in-early-access/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nebrass Homepage","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.nebrass.fr/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.nebrass.fr accesskey=h title="Nebrass Homepage (Alt + H)">Nebrass Homepage</a>
