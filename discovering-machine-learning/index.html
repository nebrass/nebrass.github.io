<div class=post-content><p>Some days ago, I got an idea to make a personal project about &ldquo;Connected Devices&rdquo;. This idea led me to discover some <em><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></em> and especially <strong><em>Machine Learning</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The first thing that I did: I started seeking for a good course in many websites: edx, coursera and udemy.. These are the most popular sites of elearning that I am usually referencing to when I want to attack new technology or any CS field.</p>
<p>But, and it&rsquo;s a bit shameful to say, I found that the ML courses are 95% based on Python 😫 and some 4% based on R 🙄 and for Java.. NOTHING !! Yeah baby ! NOTHING !!</p>
<p>This is was very scaring for me to see such as fact. But AI Guys weren&rsquo;t in love with Java 😂</p>
<p>So I started looking for something else: a full learning path mixing ML with a Python training or an ML track based on Java.</p>
<p>To be honnest, I didn&rsquo;t find something good, with many positive reviews and recommendations. I found that many Java developers went to learning Python/Scala before starting playing with Machine Learning and AI. So, I decided to do the same.</p>
<p>After some Googlings, I found a great website called DataCamp:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img loading=lazy src=../images/datacamp-homepage.webp alt>
</p>
</div>
<p>This website was very useful ! I could start a Skill Track called <a href=https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-programming><em><strong>Python Programming Track</strong></em></a>:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a practical 15 Hours learning path of Python dedicated for the Data Science, composed of 4 courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Python - 4 hours</li>
<li>Intermediate Python for Data Science - 4 hours</li>
<li>Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) - 3 hours</li>
<li>Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2) - 4 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning process were extremely interesting and the trainers are really very professional !</p>
<p>The course is a mix of videos, learning exercices and even extra practice exercices to master the subject.</p>
<p>When you finish each part, you get an accomplishment certificate, which looks like:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img loading=lazy src=../images/datacamp.webp alt>
</p>
</div>
<p>When I finished all the track, I got a certificate of accomplishment:</p>
<div align=center>
<p><img loading=lazy src=../images/pythonProgrammingTrack-1.webp alt>
</p>
</div>
<p>After I finished the tooling track, I started the second part of my ML learning trip: <a href=https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-with-python>Machine Learning with Python</a>.</p>
<p>This is a 20 hours track composed of 5 courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised Learning with scikit-learn - 4 hours</li>
<li>Unsupervised Learning in Python - 4 hours</li>
<li>Linear Classifiers in Python - 4 hours</li>
<li>Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets - 4 hours</li>
<li>Deep Learning in Python - 4 hours</li>
</ul>
